## Overview of Project

The purpose of this analysis is to provide more depth to analyses of UFO sightings by adding the ability to filter for multiple criteria at the same time to the dynamic table. Filters for the city, state, country, and shape have been added.

## Results

The dynamic table can be filtered with up to five filters. To start, head to [https://ajkriegz.github.io/UFOs/] and below is how the table will appear. Notice that each input bar has placeholder text to show the information to enter and the accepted format of the information.

Let's start by filtering for UFO sightings in Florida. Type the state's abbreviation "fl" into the appropriate filter. Then, either press Enter or click somewhere else on the screen to apply the filter.

Let's add a shape to our filters. Click inside the search bar next to the text that says "Enter Shape" and type "sphere" and this is what you will see:

You can see that we've narrowed down the results quite a bit! To remove the filters, you can choose one of the following:

* manually erase every search term you entered;

* refresh the webpage with the refresh button or by pressing ctrl + R;

* or click the text "UFO Sightings" in the top left corner of the webpage.

Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.

## Summary

Drawback -- have to know what to search for. If no results based one one misspelled or missing criterion, entire table is blank

Recommendations -- list of search terms in a dropdown box, add a reset filters button


In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.
