# UFOs

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this analysis is to provide more depth to analyses of UFO sightings by adding the ability to filter for multiple criteria at the same time to the dynamic table. Filters for the city, state, country, and shape have been added.


## Results

This dynamic table can be filtered with up to five filters. To start, head to [https://ajkriegz.github.io/UFOs/] and below is how the table will appear. Notice that each input bar has placeholder text to show the information to enter and the accepted format of the information.

Let's start by filtering for UFO sightings in Florida. Type the state's abbreviation "fl" into the appropriate filter. Then, either press Enter or click somewhere else on the screen to apply the filter.

Let's add a shape to our filters. Click inside the search bar next to the text that says "Enter Shape" and type "sphere" and this is what you will see:

You can see that we've narrowed down the results quite a bit! To remove the filters, you can choose one of the following:

* manually erase every search term you entered;

* refresh the webpage with the refresh button or by pressing ctrl + R;

* or click the text "UFO Sightings" in the top left corner of the webpage.

## Summary

### Drawbacks

One drawback to this webpage is the ambiguity of the data. What other countries have catalogued UFO sightings? What is the range of dates included in the data? What are all the different types of shapes reported? How long will the user have to search before they come across "teardrop" listed as a shape? Additionally, if even one criterion is misspelled, the filter returns an empty table.

### Recommendations

Based on the drawbacks listed above, future additions to the webpage should include a dropdown box for each filter search bar that recommends terms to search for.

For ease of use for the user, the analysis team also recommends adding a "reset filters" button to reset the dynamic table.
